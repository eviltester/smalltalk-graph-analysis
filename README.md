========================

Prototype smalltalk code for analysing graphs and converting to paths for testing

In and around 1999, 2000 I was messing around with Smalltalk and came up with a prototype for analysing graphs and flattening them automatically to allow testing to be done on them.

I eventually used this work when creating Compendium-TA

Releasing this into the public domain in case it helps anyone.
